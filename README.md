# Scientific-Project 

1.Open the To_do folder and follow instructions in the readme file there

2.Meeting reports of 7, 14 and 28 March are missing. Please upload them in the reports folder

3.Please convert all the Dutch text in every Preparation or Weekly Report into English, specifically in the Headers and Footers, like Date, Pagina into Page, wetenschappelijk structuur, ...

4.Avoid renaming the preparation or weekly report because the hyperlinks in Excel would stop working

5.Setting the hyperlinks is only useful once all the docs are corrected (converted to PDF, ...), So it has to be delayed untill all the preparations and reports are in their definitive form

6.The weekly report template has been translated into English. It is in the main folder

7.In the Excel, all the hyperlinks besides which there is green colored cells are updated and working. Please don't edit them.
